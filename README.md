# Care Staff ID Automation (Anonymised Care Provider)

A lightweight automation workflow that generates **staff onboarding ID records/cards** from structured inputs to reduce manual admin work, minimise errors, and standardise workforce onboarding.

> This repository is **anonymised**. It does not name any organisation or include real staff personal data.

## Why this project exists

Frontline care operations often require staff to be onboarded quickly, with consistent identifiers used across internal systems (rota, HR records, access control, compliance tracking). Manual ID creation can be:
- slow and repetitive,
- prone to typos/duplicates,
- inconsistent in formatting,
- difficult to audit.

This project demonstrates a practical automation approach to generate **consistent staff IDs** and onboarding-ready outputs.

---

## What it does (high level)

- Takes structured staff input (e.g., name, email, mobile number)
- Generates a standardised **Unique Staff ID**
- Produces onboarding-ready outputs (e.g., ID record, badge/card data, or formatted staff register)
- Supports repeatable processing for new recruits or batch onboarding
