# Data (Schema + Anonymised Samples)

This repo does **not** store real staff data.

Use this folder to document:
- the sheet column schema,
- safe anonymised examples,
- and guidance for generating dummy records for demos/tests.

## Recommended Google Sheet columns

Suggested minimum schema (based on the workflow evidence):

1. `Timestamp`
2. `Full Name`
3. `Mobile Number`
4. `Email Address`
5. `Merge status` (YAMM status such as SENT / OPENED / RESPONDED)
6. `Staff ID` (generated by Apps Script)

## Anonymised sample data guidance

If you add sample data files later, keep them strictly anonymised:
- Use anonymised/sample type names (e.g., “Test User 01”)
- Use reserved example domains (e.g., `example.com`)
- Use dummy numbers (never real phone numbers)
- Remove any internal links, addresses, or IDs that trace back to real systems

Example safe email format:
- `test.user01@example.com`

Example safe phone format:
- `07000000000`

## Optional: include a sample CSV

If you want, add a file like:
- `sample_staff_registration_anonymised.csv`

Containing 5–10 dummy rows only (no real data).
